Golf Dataset - one way ANOVA  
  One-Way ANOVA is used to compare the means of three or more independent groups to determine if at least one group differs significantly from the others.  
  Did an Excel calculations too.  
Dialysis Dataset - two way ANOVA  
  A Two-Way ANOVA is used when we have two independent categorical variables (factors) and want to analyze their effects on a continuous dependent variable. It also checks if 
  the two factors interact.
